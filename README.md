## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jackson Amadi, a passionate learner and problem solver in the field of cloud-native technologies and DevOps. My journey in software development began with a deep interest in understanding the intricacies of cloud infrastructure and its ability to power modern applications. Over time, I have expanded my skillset to Python, Go, JavaScript, Rust, Java, and more, enabling me to work on diverse projects and solve various challenges.

When it comes to coding, I enjoy exploring different programming languages, experimenting with new technologies, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Recently, I have been fascinated by Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and its potential to streamline development, deployment, and scalability. As a result, I have delved into tools such as Terraform to build robust and scalable architectures, with a particular focus on leveraging AWS services.
